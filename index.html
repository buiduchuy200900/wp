          <div>Have you any programming or web design experience?</div>
          <div>Yes I have. Well, in the Introduction to IT course, I had an opportunity to program a personal website like this one.</div>

          <div>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</div>
          <div>To be honest, I believe that I am probably good at both of those skills. I have a good imagination and according to testmycreativity.com, I got a high score (79) so I totally confident in my creativity. Besides, in my opinion, programming is not too hard to learn and utilize. As a result, I strongly believe that if I can imagine how to design a website, it is possible for me to program it.</div>

          <div>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</div>
          <div>In my opinion, Web Programming is the compulsory skill of a programmer. In fact that, the trend of most of big companies such as Google, Coca-Cola or Apple in the evolution of technology that using the webisite as a type of bussiness by uploading their information about the company or products for everybody. As a result, many people could get those information easily and it increases the incoming of the company. Therefore, the programmers who have a knowledge about web programming would get a job easier than the other. Moreover, it is more flexible at work for a web programmers because they probably can work as a freelancer at home or they could start-up by themselves. </div>

          <div>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</div>
          <div>Firstly, learning the fundamental of programming website is necessary to begin this course like doing this assignment, I can get used to utilize HTML. Secondly, I would like to learn how to use the web program languages such as HTML, CSS or PHP more deeply. Finally, it is important for me to study about the structure of a website like how to make a good website or how to impress the users.
          </div>

          <div>Assignments allow for individual or paried work. What strengths do you have and what strengths would you like your assignment partner to have?</div>
          <div>After doing some assignments at RMIT, I have required some experiences and skills while working as a team. First of all, I strongly believe that I can work very hardly because I don't want to let my teammates down. Secondly, I am good at organizing works for each members in a team. Finally, I also confident in working alone if I have bad teammates but I never want this situation would be happened so while choosing teammates I prefer to find someone who also hard-working. Moreover, it is better if they have some experiences about programming. Lastly, I want to have teammates who are enegetic and joyful so we would get less pressure while working and always in a good mood.</div>

          <div>What websites do you use the most? (NB: "family friendly" !)</div>
          <div>I always use facebook for my study, work and relax because there are a lot of information in that website which users can use for many purposes and most of my friends is using this type of website so Facebook is also the way I contact with my friends. Besides, rmit.instructure is the website that I use very regurlarly for studying and checking my schedule to make sure that I remember my lessons and deadlines. Finally, Youtube is the best option that I choose when I have a freetime, the same as Facebook, I use this website for many purpose such as studying and relaxing, I am good at learning by listening so that's why I can use Youtube to learn the new things.</div>

          <div>Do you have any interests or hobbies?</div>
          <div>In my free time, I prefer to study by myself about many type of subjects. Besides, I play game, listen to music or read a book and in the weekend, me and my friend always play football.</div>
